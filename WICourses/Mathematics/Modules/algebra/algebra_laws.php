<p>
The original order of operations in some countries was BODMAS, which stands for:
<ol>
<li>Brackets</li>
<li>Orders or pOwers</li>
<li>Division</li>
<li>Multiplication</li>
<li>Addition</li>
<li>Subtraction</li>
</ol>
 The O is sometimes associated with Of. This mnemonic was common until exponentials were added into the mnemonic. </p>
