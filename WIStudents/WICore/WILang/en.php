    "about_sector" => "Many of the charity’s activities serve a dual purpose of raising funds and changing our clients lives through our flagship TEN – Training, Enterprise, Nurture – scheme. 63 people benefited from this scheme in 2014-15.
Some of our clients self-refer, some are referred by other agencies familiar with the range of services we offer.",

    "about_last" => "In turn, The River Manchester can act as a gateway to services that we do not directly provide – safe refuge, housing, benefits and immigration services and so on.
We provide in-house training, self-development opportunities, inspiration, counsel and both job-seeking and employability skills for individuals whose confidence and faith in life has often been severely damaged.
At our base in Openshaw, our busy and well-stocked shop is seen by the local community as a valuable source of low-cost quality items. Here you can furnish your house, equip your kitchen or fill your wardrobe!
Our in-house internet café offers hot and cold drinks, snacks and light meals; community and social links for local shoppers; as well as low-cost internet access, printing and photocopying services.
Our van is busy every day of the week, collecting from donors or delivering furniture and white goods to our customers around the Greater Manchester area.",

    "about_main" => " 
The shop, van and café are staffed by our clients, introducing them to new skills and experience and growing confidence, which they often develop into nationally-recognised qualifications, through the training links we can provide.
Whatever their situation, volunteers, clients and members of the local community know that we create a safe space where people can tell their stories, share their lives and make new connections
Please turn to the ‘Becoming a Supporter’ page for ways to help us continue and expand our work in the exciting ways we are currently envisaging.

	"tab_intro"  =>  "Interest in the human body and how it functions probably developed when our ancestors began to think about the reasons why people became ill and died. All earlier cultures had someone designated as a healer who was responsible for finding plants and herbs that cured body disorders. This healer also was responsible for praying or invoking the assistance of past ancestors to help in the healing process <br />
        As cultures developed and science began to evolve, interest in and knowledge about the human body advanced. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), an Italian, was the first to correctly illustrate the human skeleton with all of its bones.
        <br /> 
        The Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) wrote a book on the human body, and the English anatomist William Harvey (1578–1657) discovered how blood circulates through the body. These are just a few of the many contributors who added to our understanding of the human body and how it functions. <br />
       Anatomy is the study of the structure or  morphology of the body and how the body parts are organized.  Physiology is the study of the functions of body parts, what they do, and how they do it. These two areas of the organization of the body are so closely associated that it is difficult to separate them. For example, our mouth has teeth to break down food mechanically, a tongue that tastes the food and manipulates it, and salivary glands that produce saliva containing enzymes that break down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars, thus beginning the process of digestion. Pathology is the study of the diseases of the body.  <br />
       We still do not know everything about how the human body functions. Research is still going on today to discover the mysteries of this complex unit we call  ourselves. To facilitate uniformity of terms, scientists have adopted four basic reference systems of bodily organization. These systems are directions, planes, cavities, and structural units. When referring to terms of  direction, planes, and cavities, the human body is erect and facing forward. The arms are at the sides and the palms of the hand and feet are positioned toward the front  (Figure 1-1). All descriptions of location or position assume the body to be in this posture.",

       "direction"  => "Terms of Direction",


       "tab_direction"  =>   "When an anatomist (one who studies the human body’s structures) is describing parts of the body, it is necessary to make reference to their positions in regard to the body as a whole. The following directional terms have been established to facilitate these references. Use Figure 1-2 as your guide as these terms are defined. <br />
       Superior means uppermost or above. Example: the head is superior to the neck; the thoracic cavity is superior to the abdominal cavity. Inferior means lowermost or below. Example: the foot is inferior to the ankle; the ankle is inferior to the knee. Anterior means toward the front. Example: the mammary glands are on the anterior chest wall. The term ventral can also be used for anterior. Ventral means the belly side. Posterior means toward the back. Example: the vertebral column is posterior to the digestive tract; the esophagus is posterior to the trachea. The term dorsal can also be used for posterior. Dorsal means the back side. Cephalad (SEF-ah-lad) or cranial means toward the head. It is synonymous with superior. Example: the thoracic cavity lies cephalad (or superior) to the abdominopelvic cavity. Occasionally, caudal (KAWD-al) is synonymous with inferior. However, caudal specifically means toward the tail and, as we know, humans do not have tails as adults but we do have tails as developing embryos as do all members of the animal phylum Chordata to which humans belong. Medial means nearest the midline of the body. 
 Example: the nose is in a medial position on the face; the ulna is on the medial side of the forearm. Lateral means toward the side or away from the midline of the body. 
 Example: the ears are in a lateral position on the face; the radius is lateral to the ulna. Proximal means near the point of attachment or origin. Example: the elbow is proximal to the wrist; the knee is proximal to the ankle. Distal means away from the point of attachment or origin. Example: the wrist is distal to the elbow; the ankle is distal to the knee.
",

       "tab_planes"  =>   "Occasionally, it is useful to describe the body as having imaginary flat geometric surfaces passing through it called planes (see Figure 1-1). These terms are most useful when describing dissections to look inside an organ or the body as a whole. A midsagittal (mid-SAJ-ih-tal) plane vertically divides the body through the midline into two equal left and right portions or halves. This is also referred to as a median plane. A sagittal plane is any plane parallel to the midsagittal or median plane vertically dividing the body into unequal right and left portions. A horizontal or transverse plane is any plane dividing the body into superior and inferior portions. A frontal or coronal plane is one that divides the anterior (or ventral) and posterior (or dorsal) portions of the body at right angles to the sagittal plane. When organs are sectioned to reveal internal structures, two other terms are often used. A cut through the long axis of an organ is called a longitudinal section, and a cut at right angles to the long axis is referred to as a transverse or cross section",

       "tab_cab"  =>  "The body has two major cavities: the dorsal cavity and the ventral cavity (Figure 1-3). Each of these is further subdivided into lesser cavities. The organs of any cavity are referred to as the viscera (VISS-er-ah). The dorsal cavity contains organs of the nervous system that coordinate the body’s functions. It is divided into the cranial cavity, which contains the brain, and the spinal cavity, which contains the spinal cord. The ventral cavity contains organs that are involved in maintaining homeostasis or a constant internal environment within small ranges of deviation (Figure 1-4). The first subdivision of the ventral cavity is the thoracic ( tho-RASS-ik) cavity. It is surrounded by the rib cage. The thoracic cavity contains the heart in a pericardial sac  referred to as the pericardial cavity, and the two lungs, each covered by the pleural membrane, are referred to as the pleural cavities. A space called the mediastinum (mee-dee-ass-TYE-num) is found between the two pleural cavities. It contains the heart, thymus gland, lymph and blood vessels, trachea, esophagus, and nerves. The diaphragm muscle separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominopelvic cavity. The abdominopelvic cavity is the second subdivision of the ventral cavity. It contains the kidneys, stomach, liver and gallbladder, small and large intestines, spleen, pancreas, and the ovaries and uterus in women. Two other terms are used when discussing the cavities of the body. The term parietal (pah-RYE-ehtal) refers to the walls of a cavity. Example: the parietal peritoneum lines the abdominal wall. The term visceral refers to the covering on an organ. Example: the visceral peritoneum covers abdominal organs.
",

	"tab_struct"  =>  "Structural Units",

	"tab_struct_text"  => "All living material is composed of cells, the smallest units of life. Cells are organized into tissues. Tissues are organized into organs, and organs are part of the major systems of the body (Figure 1-5 and Table 1-1). The cell is the basic unit of biologic organization. The liquid part of a cell is called protoplasm (PRO-toh-plazm). This protoplasm is surrounded by a limiting membrane, the cell membrane, also called the plasma membrane, which selectively determines what may enter or exit the cell. This protoplasm is an aqueous (watery), colloidal (grouping of large molecules) solution of various proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and inorganic salts that are organized into cellular structures referred to as organelles. These organelles, such as the mitochondria, ribosomes, and lysosomes, among others, are discussed in further detail in Chapter 3. A cell performs all the activities necessary to maintain life, including metabolism, assimilation,  digestion, excretion, and reproduction (see Figure 3-1 in  Chapter 3). Different kinds of cells make up a tissue (muscle or bone). Different types of tissues make up an organ (stomach or heart). Finally, organs are grouped into systems (digestive system or nervous system). Each system of the body serves some general function to maintain the body as a whole. All of the diverse tissues of the body can be placed",
