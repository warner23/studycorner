興趣人體和它的功能如何開始發展時，我們的祖先就開始思考，為什麼人們生病而死的原因。所有早期的文化有指定為治療者是誰負責發現固化體症植物和草藥的人。這也是醫者負責祈禱或調用過去祖先的援助在癒合過程中<br幫助/>
        作為文化發展和科學開始發展，興趣和知識，對人​​的身體前進。達芬奇（1452-1519），一個意大利人，是第一個正確說明其所有骨骼的人體骨骼。
        <br />
        弗拉芒解剖學家安德烈亞斯·維薩留斯（1514-1564）寫了一篇關於人體的一本書，英國解剖學家威廉·哈維（1578-1657）發現血液循環如何通過身體。這些只是少數誰添加到我們人體的理解，它的功能如何在眾多的貢獻者。 <br />
       解剖是身體的結構或形態的研究和主體部分是如何組織的。生理學是身體各部分的功能，他們做了什麼研究，以及他們是如何做到這一點。這兩個主體的組織的區域是如此緊密相關的，這是很難將它們分開。例如，我們的嘴有牙齒的機械分解食物，即口味的食物和操作它，一個舌頭和產生含唾液酶分解複雜的碳水化合物成單糖，從而開始消化過程唾液腺。病理是身體的疾病的研究。 <br />
       我們仍然不知道如何人體功能應有盡有。研究仍在繼續今天發現這個複雜的單位，我們稱自己的奧秘。為了便於計算的均勻性，科學家們已經通過身體組織的四個基本參考系統。這些系統的方向，平面，空腔和結構單元。當提及方向，飛機，和腔而言，人體是直立和朝前。臂是在側面和手和腳的手掌被定位朝向前（圖1-1）。地點或位置的所有描述假定的身體將處於這種姿勢.",

    "about_sector" => "Many of the charity’s activities serve a dual purpose of raising funds and changing our clients lives through our flagship TEN – Training, Enterprise, Nurture – scheme. 63 people benefited from this scheme in 2014-15.
Some of our clients self-refer, some are referred by other agencies familiar with the range of services we offer.",

    "about_last" => "In turn, The River Manchester can act as a gateway to services that we do not directly provide – safe refuge, housing, benefits and immigration services and so on.
We provide in-house training, self-development opportunities, inspiration, counsel and both job-seeking and employability skills for individuals whose confidence and faith in life has often been severely damaged.
At our base in Openshaw, our busy and well-stocked shop is seen by the local community as a valuable source of low-cost quality items. Here you can furnish your house, equip your kitchen or fill your wardrobe!
Our in-house internet café offers hot and cold drinks, snacks and light meals; community and social links for local shoppers; as well as low-cost internet access, printing and photocopying services.
Our van is busy every day of the week, collecting from donors or delivering furniture and white goods to our customers around the Greater Manchester area.",

    "about_main" => " 
The shop, van and café are staffed by our clients, introducing them to new skills and experience and growing confidence, which they often develop into nationally-recognised qualifications, through the training links we can provide.
Whatever their situation, volunteers, clients and members of the local community know that we create a safe space where people can tell their stories, share their lives and make new connections
Please turn to the ‘Becoming a Supporter’ page for ways to help us continue and expand our work in the exciting ways we are currently envisaging.
